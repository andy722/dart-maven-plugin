By default it will look for dart files in src/main/dart and will place the javascript files under ${project.build.directory}/dart.\r\n\r\nMore configuration details:\r\n\r\n### `dart:dart2js` Goal to compile dart files to javascript. \r\n\r\nPlease use mvn dart:help for more information.\r\n    \r\n##Example\r\n\r\nAn example can be found in the example folder in the git repository.\r\n\r\n##Maven repository\r\n\r\nThe Dart Maven Plugin is provided in the In2Experience repository https://dev.in2experience.com/nexus/content/repositories/public-release/\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nDaniel Zwicker (@dzwicker) founded the project on GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Comitter\r\n\r\n* @youngm","name":"Dart-maven-plugin","note":"Don't delete this file!
