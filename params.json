It is already bound to his proper phase within the Maven Lifecycle (compile) and is therefore, automatically executed during his respective phase.\r\n\r\n* `dart:dart2js` Goal which compile dart files to javascript.\r\n* `dart:help`  Display help information on maven-dart-plugin. Call mvn dart:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name> to display parameter details.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nThe dart2js goal uses the dart2js compiler from the dart project to compile any dart file to javascript (js file) and a map.js file. It will download the latest dart SDK into the dartOutputDirectory [${project.build.directory}/dependency/dart] for the used OS and architecture. By default it will look for dart files in src/main/dart and will place the javascript files under ${project.build.directory}/dart.\r\n\r\nMore configuration details:\r\n\r\n### `dart:dart2js` Goal which compile dart files to javascript. \r\n\r\n* `checkedMode (Default: false)` Insert runtime type checks and enable assertions (checked mode).\r\n* `dartOutputDirectory` The directory for downloading the dart SDK.\r\n* `dartServerUrl` The base URL for Downloading the dart SDK from\r\n* `dartVersion`  The Version of the dart SDK\r\n* `excludes` A list of exclusion filters for the dart2js compiler.\r\n* `executable` provide a dart2js executable\r\n* `includes` A list of inclusion filters for the dart2js compiler.\r\n* `outputDirectory` The directory to place the js files after compiling.\r\n* `serverId` settings.xml's server id for the URL. This is used when wagon needs extra authentication information.\r\n* `skip (Default: false)` Skip the execution of dart2js.\r\n* `skipVM (Default: false)` Skip downloading dart VM.\r\n* `staleMillis (Default: 0)` Sets the granularity in milliseconds of the last modification date for testing whether a dart source needs recompilation.\r\n    \r\n##Example\r\n\r\nAn example can be found in the example folder in the git repository.\r\n\r\n##Maven repository\r\n\r\nThe Dart Maven Plugin is provided in the In2Experience repository https://dev.in2experience.com/nexus/content/repositories/public-release/\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nDaniel Zwicker (@shadowdz) founded the project on GitHub.","name":"Dart-maven-plugin"}
